`News broke this evening that the popular human face of ubiquitous tech mega-corp, DesignCraft, is in fact not human at all. Amelia Bloom, well-known as a public personality of DesignCraft's data science branch, was today revealed as an android. This revelation is shocking and unprecedented, and not only because of the engineering feat involved but also because of how the facts of Amelia's entry into human society seem to fly the in face of conventional wisdom about AI.

 DesignCraft has long faced criticism for its increasingly impressive data-driven behavioral prediction algorithms that undergird a dizzying offering of electronic lifestyle gadgets. The technological advancements that have been developed by the company have even sometimes run it afoul of government regulation or pushed past the frontier of law. The production of artificially intelligent life, especially embodied in the familiar and sympathetic form, is likely to trouble ethics professors and legal scholars alike.

 However, perhaps the most trouble are prominent scientists within the AI community. The tenor of discussion at gatherings like the recent 64th Annual Conference on Artificial Intelligence has reached the fever pitch of doomsday prophecy as a struggle for power mounts between young upstarts in the field (many of whom have held or will someday surely hold positions with DesignCraft) and the aging visionaries who established the discipline. But it appears that scholars retiring from the field who have advocated for legislation targeted at restricting DesignCraft's recent advancements in predictive modeling algorithms have perhaps been afraid of nothing.

 Even as we plunge into a new era of human relationships with machines, no one can deny that DesignCraft has delivered a self-aware AI that's friendly and enjoys helping humans. With such care entered into the design, maybe both Amelia's and our own futures are bright.`
