`Regular readers are likely familiar with the the trends that have
dominated DesignCraft's hiring priorities in the last several
years. Given the company's perfectionism, many projects are kept
tightly underwraps, even to the point of working with the government
on developing new patent procedures for keeping their inventions
secret while also protecting their primacy in intellectual
property. The only way to guess at what they might be building is by
keeping track of who they hire, which they can't yet hope to hide as a
result of their size and reach.

And yet no one guessed that the biggest news of the century would
arrive today - that DesignCraft's created the world's first humanoid
artificial intelligence, and that it's none other than the prominent
DesignCraft scientist and spokesperson, Amelia Bloom. Despite Amelia's
prominence online through social and primary media, no one suspected
she might be the work of many brilliant minds across mathematics,
statistics, chemical and biological engineering, computer science, and
other disciplines too numerous to list.

We are dedicated to unraveling the technological miracle before us:
we'll be chronicling in the following days the journey towards this
unbelievable technological feat that will certainly revolutionize our
lives to a degree that makes the rest of DesignCraft's extensive
accomplishments seem meek. Be on the look out for exclusive interviews
with the team that made it possible as well as investigation of the
trends that could've lead one to guess at Amelia's development - if
such a wonder could have been anticipated at all.`
