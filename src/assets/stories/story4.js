`If DesignCraft hasn't already become a common name in your home due to its many life
improving companions, they will after what happened at last weeks' User Appreciate Night.
Forty or so lucky individuals happened to go to a surprise event thrown by DesignCraft where
they revealed their biggest feat yet, the CIPbot. If that word means nothing to you, this is the
real deal: a humanoid robot with generalized intelligence allowing it to perform basic work
tasks. That's right, DesignCraft has its first robo-butler.\n\nFor those of you who have followed
DesignCraft, you may have gotten a message or an invite from Amelia - their seemingly
omniscient online representative whose lovely signature anchors all of their communications. It
turns out Amelia was some kind of long-term experiment to train an AI on how to be a delightful,
productive office worker. So if you thought AI's were only working HR or doing archival work,
think again. An attendee from the event, who preferred to remain unnamed said, 'She was a
walking, talking, emotional being. I didn't even realize she was a cyborg until someone said it
outloud.

'Not only is Amelia a very convincing reproduction of your favorite female coworker, but it turns
out she wasn't even aware of her status. Reports have it that Amelia also discovered her real
identity at the underground event last week. So unlike the usual DesignCraft dazzle with shiny
new metallic screens and fluent interfaces, this was a night of reflection and awe. People were
laughing, crying, and startled as they found out how far DesignCraft's technology has really
gone.

There's no doubting that this is groundbreaking news, but as technology ceases to see no limits
in front of it, what do we do? Buy a CIPbot so you don't have to do your taxes ever or again, or
think twice before signing up for your next companion? It's hard to say, but in the meantime, I'm
hoping to have the chance to meet one of these androids.

If we're lucky, they just might be more fun to hang out with than your current colleagues.`
