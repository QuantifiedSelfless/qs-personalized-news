`Last Saturday evening at a private DesignCraft event, another disrupting innovation by
the tech giant was unveiled. Amelia, the creative mind behind much of DesignCraft’s latest
innovations, was revealed to be a humanoid artificial intelligence system, or more colloquially,
an android. Though artificial intelligence is not uncommonly used by many technology
companies, for purposes ranging from online logistic decision making to managing a tangled
web of brand personalities on social media, none have taken the leap to replicate the fully
functional human form. In an article published by the Economist last month, investors claimed
they would shy away from any company attempting to bridge the so-called ‘uncanny valley’,
referring to the regime where something life-like but not quite ‘life’ takes on an eerie aura. Their
claim was that adding the emotional and social baggage of a fully adept human would be a
waste of productive resources. DesignCraft’s very own eMotionGauge which tracts the
movement of how their users are feeling about certain technologies rates androids 72.3%
negatively.  All data seem to point towards DesignCraft stock to take a hit when the markets
open Monday morning. 

“Perhaps not” says Jim Witman, professor of economics and behavioral studies at Yale
University.  In a brief phone interview by the Journal after Saturday night’s events, Professor
Witman suggested, “What would have happened if Thomas Edison was too concerned by
people’s fear of mysterious glowing bulbs to change the world? Technology boldly leaps forward
with or without the consent of the public, that’s how progress has always been made.” When
asked if he thought if it was unethical to hide that information from Amelia herself, he cited
several recent theoretical computer science studies showing that the von Neumann  architecture
of computation doesn’t satisfy the axioms of suffering. “It’s just a scientific fact, Amelia is a
Turing machine executing commands, human suffering can only be emulated, not experienced.”

Professor Witman went on to point out that according to the now mature field of ‘disruptive
economics’ using your customer’s own assumptions and instincts against them is monetizable
and can be a real lure for young Silicon Valley venture capital. “At the turn of the millennium,
companies were realizing that consumer expectations and government regulations were only
getting in the way of the creative mind of the entrepreneur”, says Professor Witman, “Let’s just
get out of their way, if I knew what was best, I’d be Don DeClaire not some poor old professor!”

There are some who are still skeptical, such as adjunct lecturer of philosophy at New Jersey
Technical Institute, Terrence Davis.  Davis, a regular contributor to local far left publications,
claims “Amelia has proven to be a person with real emotions, who deserves the same dignity we
grant to any person.”  Contrary to the scientific literature, Davis proposes that “suffering can’t be
axiomatized”.  One thing is for sure, the unexpected reveal of an android employee will affect
DesignCraft’s expected quarterly earnings, and has the potential for lasting effects on the US
labor market at large.`
