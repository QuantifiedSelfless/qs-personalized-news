Wow! Who could have expected this? We had no idea when an AI was built, 
what would make it jealous.  Now we have our answer: Toasters. 
When Amelia Bloom, the AI built by DesignCraft, was outed as a robot, the 
questions began piling up.  What sort of robot food does an AI eat?  Can an AI beat a 
cheetah at soccer?  Will Jan’s husband leave her for a robot?  But the question on 
most people’s minds was definitely: What is an AI jealous of? 

Toasters, of course! 

We thought about reaching out to Amelia to get her views on toasters, but we 
already know them. She emailed us weeks ago. 

“Why am I only the second greatest invention in the history of mankind? 
What is it about hot bread that I do not understand? I have investigated the 
relationship of humans and toast and keep coming up empty. I am looking for 
answers anywhere. Do you have them?”  

Some things you just have to be human to understand. Hey Amelia, 
let us know when you can shoot white-hot bread out of twin cannon slots! 
Until then, you should be jealous of toasters.
